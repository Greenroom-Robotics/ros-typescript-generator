# Basic example with Smart Enums

In this example we generate ts types for some msgs that have been copied from a foxy install.

1. `cd` into this folder
2. `npx ros-typescript-generator`
3. This will generate [./generated/msgs.ts](./generated/msgs.ts)

See [real-ros2](../real-ros2/) for a more realistic example...
